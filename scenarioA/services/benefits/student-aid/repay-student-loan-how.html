					        <h2>Make a plan before starting to repay your student debt</h2>
					<p>Consider the following before paying down your student debt.</p>
					<h3>How much you need to repay</h3>
					<p>Figure out the following:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>the total amount you owe</li>
					<li>the interest rate that will be applied to your debt</li>
					<li>how you’ll repay your debt</li>
					<li>how much you’ll pay each month</li>
					<li>how long it will take to pay back your debt</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Make sure you know the date your payment is due. Note that if you have more than one loan, or a line of credit, you may have more than one payment due date.</p>
					<h3>Who you need to repay</h3>
					<p>After graduation, you may have loans or lines of credit that you need to repay to the government and/or your financial institution.</p>
					<p>In some provinces and territories, Canada Student Loans are issued separately by the federal and provincial/territorial governments. This means that you could have more than one loan to pay back.</p>
					<p><a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/education/student-loan/pay-back.html">Find out where to pay back your Canada Student Loan depending on which province or territory gave you the loan.</a></p>
					<h3>Your repayment schedule</h3>
					<p>Contact your loan provider to determine your loan repayment schedule. Your repayment schedule will tell you when you have to make payments and how much each payment will be.</p>
					<p>Your repayment schedule may be part of your loan or line of credit contract. Be sure you’re aware of this information before you sign the contract.</p>
					<h4>Canada Student Loans repayment schedule</h4>
					<p>Contact your loan provider to confirm when and how your payments have to be made.</p>
					<p>Once you read and accept the Canada Student Loan repayment schedule, sign and return it to your loan provider. Payments may be withdrawn from your account even if they don’t receive your signature.</p>




			               <h2>How to make payments</h2>
										 <p>Monthly payments can be made by automatic withdrawal, cheque, online banking or telephone banking.</p>
										 <p>When repayment begins
										 <p>You will receive a notice that your loan repayments are about to begin. If you have not received anything by mail, make sure you contact your loan provider(s) before your six month non-repayment period is over. You will want to review all aspects of your loan(s) and finalize details concerning:</p>
			               <ul>
			                 <li>how much you owe; </li>
			                 <li>the interest rate that will be applied to your loan(s);</li>
			                 <li>the bank account you will use to repay the loan;</li>
			                 <li>the monthly amount that will be withdrawn from your bank account; </li>
			                 <li>the date it will be withdrawn (if you are set up for automatic withdrawals);</li>
			                 <li>how to send monthly payments to your loan provider(s) (normally via cheque if you are not set up for  automatic withdrawals); and</li>
			                 <li>how long it will take to pay back your loan(s).</li>
