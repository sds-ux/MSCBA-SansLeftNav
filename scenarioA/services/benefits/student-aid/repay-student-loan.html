		<h2>When you need to start making payments</h2>
		<p>Different student loans and line of credit have different rules on when you need to start making payments.</p>
		<h3>Canada Student Loans</h3>
		<p>If you have a Canada Student Loan or a provincial student loan, you don’t have to make payments on that loan as long as you’re in school.</p>
		<ul><li><a href="manage-student-loan">Delay repayment and keep your loan interest free if you are still studying or a reservist in the Canadian Forces in a designated operation</a></li></ul>
		<p>You’ll have to start repaying your loan if you:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>graduate from your studies</li>
		<li>transfer from full-time to part-time studies</li>
		<li>leave school</li>
		<li>take time off school for more than 6 months</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After you graduate, there is a six-month grace period until you have to begin making payments on your Canada Student Loan or provincial student loan. Be aware that interest will accumulate during this time.</p>
		<p>You can choose to pay the interest you owe during this six-month grace period in the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>start making payments right away</li>
		<li>pay the six months’ interest as a lump sum before you start making your regular payments</li>
		<li>have your loan providers add the six-months’ worth of interest to the total amount of your loan</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interest rates when repaying your Canada Student Loan</h4>
		<p>When repaying your Canada Student Loan, you can choose a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate. A fixed interest rate is a rate of interest that doesn’t change for the length of your loan. A variable interest rate is a rate of interest that may change depending on the current market interest rate.</p>
		<p><a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/education/student-loan/interest-rates.html">Find out how interest is calculated on your Canada Student Loan.</a></p>
		<h3>Student lines of credit</h3>
		<p>If you have a student line of credit through your financial institution, you'll have to pay the interest on the amount of money you borrow while you’re still in school.</p>
		<p>After you graduate, many financial institutions give you a 4- to 12-month grace period. During this time, you only have to pay the interest on your line of credit. After this, you’ll pay back the money you borrowed by following a repayment schedule. You agree upon a repayment schedule with your financial institution.</p>
		<p>Speak with your financial institution to get information about paying back your student line of credit.</p>
		<p><a href="/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/loans/student-lines-credit.html">Find out what you should consider before applying for or using a student line of credit.</a></p>




		<p class="pagetag">It is time to start repaying your loan when you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>have graduated from your studies;</li>
      <li>have transferred to part-time studies;</li>
      <li>have left school; or</li>
      <li>are taking time off school for more than six months.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the first six months after you leave school, you will not have to make payments to your Canada Student Loan or your provincial student loan. This is called your six month non-repayment period. However, during this period, interest does accumulate. You can either choose to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>start making the interest payments right away;</li>
      <li>pay the six months' interest as a lump sum before you start making your regular payments; or</li>
      <li>have your loan providers add the interest amount to your loan total after the six month non-repayment period. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is your responsibility to contact your loan provider(s) to set up a repayment schedule before you have to start making payments after the six month non-repayment period. Loan providers will try to contact you via mail or phone, but it is your obligation to set up and manage your loan payments should they not be able to reach you.</p>
    <p>If you do not make contact, your loan payments may start to be automatically withdrawn after the six month non-repayment period from the same bank account where your loans were deposited (if you had arranged for direct deposit). </p>
    <p>Create an <a rel="external" href="https://csnpe-nslsc.cibletudes-canlearn.ca/eng/Default.aspx">online NSLSC account</a> to stay in touch and keep your contact information up-to-date. </p>
